# DeepInfix

This is a deep learning library to learn all the infix operations in python.

Right now we are working on equivalence types i.e. "==", "<=", "!=", etc.

## Getting Started

You can install everything you need for the project by running `uv sync`, once you have all the packages you need, you can run the main entry point with `uv run main.py --flag==value`.

The easiest way to change configuration values is editing the configuration file (`configs/config.yaml`) with your favorite text editor (`nvim`).
